# This YAML defines a complete CI/CD Pipeline that automates running Playwright tests and publishing three different types of reports to GitHub Pages.

# High-Level Flow
# Triggers: Runs automatically on push to main/dev, on any pull_request, or via manual workflow_dispatch.
# Job 1 (test): Executes the tests and saves the results as "Artifacts" (temporary files stored by GitHub).
# Job 2 (publish-reports): Collects those artifacts, merges them, and hosts them on a public URL.

# Detailed Breakdown

# Job 1: test (The Execution Phase)
# Environment Setup: Uses npm ci for a clean install and specifically installs only Chromium (npx playwright install chromium --with-deps) to save time and bandwidth.
# Test Run: Executes a specific test file (loginpage.spec.ts) for the QA environment. It uses DOTENV_PRIVATE_KEY_QA from GitHub Secrets to decrypt your local environment variables.
# Report Generation:
# Allure: It attempts to transform raw allure-results into a viewable HTML allure-report.
# if: always(): This is critical. It ensures that even if tests fail, the reports are still generated and uploaded.
# Artifact Storage: Uses actions/upload-artifact to save three separate reports: Allure, Playwright Default, and a custom Playwright HTML report.

# Job 2: publish-reports (The Hosting Phase)
# needs: test: This job waits for the testing job to finish.
# Download: It retrieves the three report folders uploaded in the previous job.
# Consolidation: It creates a folder called gh-pages-deploy and copies all three reports into it.
# Deployment: Uses the peaceiris/actions-gh-pages action. This pushes the consolidated reports to a special branch called gh-pages.
# URL Output: Prints the final live links where you can view your test results in a browser.

# Fault Tolerance: The use of continue-on-error: true and if: always() ensures the pipeline doesn't just "die" if a test fails; you still get to see why it failed in the report.
# Security: It uses the built-in ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} to handle the deployment to GitHub Pages, so you don't need to generate a manual PAT for this repo.
# Efficiency: It cleans the report directory (--clean) and uses a shallow fetch (fetch-depth: 0) to keep the runner's disk usage low.
# Note: For the links in Step 6 to work, you must enable GitHub Pages in your repository settings and set the source to the gh-pages branch.
